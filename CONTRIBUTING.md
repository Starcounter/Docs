## Style Guidelines

To make the documentation more streamlined and coherent, we have a set of guidelines. 


### General Guidelines

#### Headlines should be capitalized consistently

For consistent headline capitalizing, we're following the title captitalization rules here: https://capitalizemytitle.com/.

In short:
* Capitalize the first word in the title
* Capitalize the last word in the title
* Capitalize the important words in the title

This applies to all pages on headlines H1, H2, and H3.

### Topic Guides Guidelines

#### Every Ppage should have an introduction

The introduction should be on the top of the page below a H1 headline that says "Introduction".

The introduction should give a brief explanation of the topic. People should know if the page has what they're looking for by reading the introduction.

If the content of the page is so short that all of it could be fit into an introduction, then the page should either be merged into another page or expanded. 

### Cookbook Guidelines

#### Pages should use the same structure

All cookbook examples should use this structure:

* Goal
* Step by step solution
* Summary

These three should be the only top-level headlines in the page. The goal is a short description the problem that's solved by the cookbook. The step by step solution goes through the steps to accomplish that goal in a way that anyone can follow. The summary explains what's been done in 1-3 sentences, links to additional resources and describes things to keep in mind when using the solution.
