## Style Guidelines

To make the documentation more streamlined and coherent, we have a set of guidelines. 

### Structure

#### Every Page Should Have an Introduction

The introduction should be on the top of the page below a H1 headline that says "Introduction".

The introduction should give a brief explanation of the topic. People should know if the page has what they're looking for by reading the introduction.

If the content of the page is so short that all of it could be fit into an introduction, then the page should either be merged into another page or expanded. 

This only applies to the pages in the topic guides.

### Headlines

#### Headlines Should be Capitalized Consistently

For consistent headline capitalizing, we're following the title captitalization rules here: https://capitalizemytitle.com/.

In short:
* Capitalize the first word in the title
* Capitalize the last word in the title
* Capitalize the important words in the title

This applies to all pages on headlines H1, H2, and H3.
