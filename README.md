# Starcounter Documentation

This is the official documentation for Starcounter. It is divided into five main parts:

1. [Starcounter](/starcounter/): a brief walkthrough of what Starcounter is
2. [Tutorial](/tutorial/): an introduction to Starcounter for new Starcounter developers
3. [Guides](/guides/): the bulk of the documentation which explains how different Starcounter features work. The [essential reading list](guides/#essential-reading) provides a good starting point
4. [Cookbook](/cookbook/): common solutions and code patterns in Starcounter
5. [Glossary](/glossary/): definitions of some common words used in the documentation

On the left you can choose to read the documentation for different versions of Starcounter as they correspond to the release channels.

There are also a plethora of sample apps available in the [StarcounterApps](https://github.com/Starcounterapps) repository.
