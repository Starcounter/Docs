# Puppet web apps

## What is an app?

A Starcounter app adheres the following principles:

1. Does one thing and does it well.

2. Can run simultaneously with other apps.

3. Can share data with other apps.

4. Can share screen with other apps.

On the following pages we will examine how to put these principles to practice.

This chapter discusses the implementation of a MVVM architecture for web apps, in which the server controls the application using server-side view-models.

The UI can be presented to the user using a web standards-based, thin client library called [PuppetJs](/guides/web-apps/puppet).
