# Puppet web apps

This chapter discusses the implementation of a MVVM architecture for web apps, in which the server controls the application using [server-side view-models](/guides/web/server-side-view-models/). 

The UI can be presented to the user using a web standards-based, thin client library called [PuppetJs](/guides/web/puppet/).
