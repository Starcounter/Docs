# RESTful web apps

Previous chapter showed how easy it is to create a fast web app using Puppet, a protocol that synchronizes the application state between the server and the client using JSON-Patch.

For more traditional use cases, Starcounter makes it also possible to offer a REST API with minimum development and performance overhead. 

This section presents the techniques used to achieve common patterns in REST APIs. It extends the topics discussed in higher details in chapters [JSON](/guides/json/) and [Network](/guides/network/).
