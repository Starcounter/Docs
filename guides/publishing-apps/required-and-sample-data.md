# Required and sample data

The app should not create required nor sample data without the user's consent.

## Required data

If the app requires any data to operate \(for example a list of the world's countries in the `Country` table\), it should present a nagging information with a button that creates the data:

* on the top of the main page
* possibly in every view that needs the required data

## Sample data

If the app offers some nice-to-have sample data, it should offer a button that creates this data:

* on the main page, in a welcome message that is dismissible once \(not per user\)
* on the [Settings page](settings-page.md)
