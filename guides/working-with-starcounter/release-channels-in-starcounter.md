# Release channels in Starcounter

Starcounter supports a number of different release [channels](http://downloads.starcounter.com/download). We use these channels to roll out updates to users, starting with our close to hourly builds, all the way up to our Release channel releases.

### Types of releases:

#### Release
Stability: **High**, Frequency: **Low**

This channel has gotten through full testing and blessing of Starcounter team and our clients. It correctly correlates with all Sample Apps and Prefab Apps, so the release version is the best way to enjoy Starcounter functionality. It is updated approximately once in a few weeks. Documentation matches the latest release version in this channel unless stated otherwise.

#### Release Candidate
Stability: **Medium**, Frequency: **High**

This channel is for versions that are stable enough to be considered for release. It's updated daily with bug fixes, although no big new functionality will be introduced in the Release Candidate.

#### Develop
Stability: **Low**, Frequency: **High**

This channel is unstable iterated release channel, that is updated every night after a full day of work on imperfections and occasional bugs. Features from the Develop release are most probable to appear in the next “Release” version. Feel free to use it for the bleeding edge developer experience.

#### Custom
Stability: **Varied**, Frequency: **Varied**

This channel is for custom builds that are used for specific purposes. It may, for example, help to detect problems in an environment. Releases of this channel should mainly be used by developers who are explicitly directed to them by our support.

#### Long-term support (LTS)
Stability: **High**, Frequency: **Low-Medium**

This channel is updated nightly when there are hotfixes and patches for the latest release of the Release channel. There will not be a major release in this channel unless there is also a release in the Release channel, thus, this channel and the Release channel does not differ in functionality.
