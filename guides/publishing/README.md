# Publishing on the App Warehouse

If your app is blendable, it might be used in complex UI systems consisting of multiple apps coming from different vendors.

To make sure that the apps play well together, the App Warehouse enforces several conventions.

These conventions exist for two reasons:

1. to prevent conflicts between apps in the same database
2. to provide a common ground, expectable user experience
