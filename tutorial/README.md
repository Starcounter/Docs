# Tutorials

To help you get started building apps with Starcounter, we've create two tutorials. The first tutorial is a HelloWorld tutorial which teaches the basics of Starcounter. The second focuses on blending - the process of making two apps look and work as one.

These tutorials are practical and not theorietical. The theoretical part is left to the [guides](/guides). 

We recommend that you download Starcounter and follow along. If you get stuck, post an issue in the [Home](https://github.com/Starcounter/Home/issues/new) repository on GitHub and someone in the community or at Starcounter will get back to you as soon as possible.
