## Hello World - Tutorial

In this "Hello World" tutorial you will learn how to use the essential features of Starcounter by building an expense tracker complete with a database, interactive UI, real-time syncing, and seamless integration with other applications.

In the first two steps, you will create the simplest possible application that binds the database to the view.

In the four following steps, you will create an expense tracker by establishing a UI and building functionality that allows CRUD operations on the database.

The last three steps consist of making the expense tracker integrate with other applications in a seamless fashion.

This is how it will look when you are done:
