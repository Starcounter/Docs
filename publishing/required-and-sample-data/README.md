# Required and sample data

The app should not create required nor sample data without the user's consent.

## Required data

If the app requires any data to operate (for example a list of the world's countries in the `Country` table), it should present a nagging information with a button that creates the data:

- on the top of the main page
- possibly in every view that needs the required data

## Sample data

If the app offers some nice-to-have sample data, it should offer a button that creates this data:

- in the dismissible welcome message on the main page
- on the [Settings page](../settings-page/)
