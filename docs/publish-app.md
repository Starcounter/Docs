# Publishing Starcounter 3.0 application

Starcounter supports the following runtimes:

* [`win7-x64`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#windows-rids) - for Windows 7 and newer versions.
* [`linux-x64`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#linux-rids) - for Linux based operating systems.

Self contained and framework dependent modes are supported.

_Detailed specification of the \[`dotnet publish`\]\(\(_[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish?tabs=netcore21](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish?tabs=netcore21)_\)\) command is available at the Microsoft website._

Due to [this .NET Core SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3510) issue it is not yet possible to publish Starcounter .NET Core apps as a single file.
