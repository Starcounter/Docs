# Hello World tutorial

In this "Hello World" tutorial you will learn how to use the essential features of Starcounter by building an expense tracker complete with a database, interactive UI and real-time syncing.

We will use C\# as the server-side language. All the app logic will be written in C\# and execute in the database. The client-server communication will be handled by [Palindrom](../../topic-guides/blendable-web-apps/palindrom.md) over HTTP and WebSocket. This is how we recommend building Starcounter apps.

## Content {#content}

In the four following steps, you will create an expense tracker by establishing a UI and building functionality that allows CRUD operations on the database.
