Great job finishing this tutorial!

Now you know plenty about how to use Starcounter. We hope that you're eager to learn more.

Here are some resources that might be useful in starting to create your own applications:

1. [KitchenSink](https://github.com/StarcounterSamples/KitchenSink) demonstrates how to create different UI patterns.
2. The [guides ](../../topic-guides/) gives an in-depth look into different Starcounter topics. 
3. [Starcounter sample apps](http://starcounter.io/sample-apps/) which you can mix, match, and edit however you like.

Good luck!
