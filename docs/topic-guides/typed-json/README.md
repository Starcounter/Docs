# Typed JSON

## Introduction

Typed JSON are C\# classes that are serializeable to JSON. This makes it easy to work with JSON documents in an object-oriented manner.

 The view-models are Typed JSON in Starcounter web apps.

[JSON-by-example](json-by-example.md) defines it, the [Code-Behind](code-behind.md) extends it, and it's [bound](data-bindings.md) to database data.

## Content

This section describes how to use Typed JSON.

* [JSON-by-example](json-by-example.md) and [code-behind](code-behind.md) describes how to define the Typed JSON and extend it to allow for interactivity.
* [JSON data bindings](data-bindings.md) explains how to initially add database data to the Typed JSON objects and then bind Typed JSON objects to database classes.
* [Callback methods](callback-methods.md) describes the use of callback methods for certain actions on the Typed JSON objects.
* [Primitive arrays and single value types](primitive-arrays-and-single-value-types.md) and [Typed JSON Internals](typed-json-internals.md) covers topics that, in most cases, are not practically applicable but can still be useful in some niche cases.
