# Hello World - Tutorial

In this "Hello World" tutorial you will learn how to use the essential features of Starcounter by building an expense tracker complete with a database, interactive UI and real-time syncing.

We will use C\# as the server-side language. All the app logic will be written in C\# and execute in the database. The client-server communication will be handled by [Palindrom](../guides/blendable-web-apps/palindrom.md) over HTTP and WebSocket. This is how we recommend building Starcounter apps.

## Content

In the first two steps, you will create the simplest possible application that binds the database to the view.

In the four following steps, you will create an expense tracker by establishing a UI and building functionality that allows CRUD operations on the database.
