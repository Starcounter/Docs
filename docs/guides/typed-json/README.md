# Typed JSON

### Summary

Typed JSON are C\# classes that are serializeable to JSON. The classes make up the view-model in Starcounter.

[JSON-by-example](json-by-example.md) defines it, the [Code-Behind](code-behind.md) extends it, and it's \[bound\]\(\(/guides/typed-json/json-data-bindings\) to database data.

### Content

This section describes how to use Typed JSON.

* [JSON-by-example](json-by-example.md) and [Code-Behind](code-behind.md) describes how to define the Typed JSON and extend it to allow for interactivity.
* [JSON Data Bindings](json-data-bindings.md) explains how to initially add database data to the Typed JSON objects and then bind Typed JSON objects to database classes.
* [Callback Methods](callback-methods.md) describes the use of callback methods for certain actions on the Typed JSON objects.
* [Responding With JSON](responding-with-json.md) and [Accepting JSON in Requests](/guides/typed-json/accepting-JSON-in-requests/README.md) describes how to send and receive Typed JSON objects using HTTP.
* [Primitive Arrays and Single Value Types](primitive-arrays-and-single-value-types.md) and [Typed JSON Internals](typed-json-internals.md) covers topics that, in most cases, are not practically applicable but can still be useful in some niche cases.
